Case editing, initial
    start a new script, focus should be ready on first empty case
    clicking on case area when there are no cases creates and focuses one

    edit a case, move focus up or down, reload page, change should be persisted
    edit a case, click on script title area, reload page, change should be persisted
    pressing enter when a case is selected (not focused) puts focus on that case
    pressing enter when a case is focused starts a new case below
    new case gets an ID in the left-hand column
    select several rows, pressing enter should reduce the selection and focus on the last selected case
    cursor left/right on focus moves the caret, limited to the case input field
    cursor left/right with no focus, and with run selected, moves run selection (need a few runs to see)
    cursor left/right with nothing selected selects first/last run
    cursor up/down moves selected case
    cursor up/down with multiple rows selected reduces selection to one row above/below the last selected row
    cursor up/down with no case selected (press escape a few times) puts focus on first row
    tab indents case
    tab can't indent if already indented
    tab can't indent first case
    tab can't indent after six levels deep
    shift-tab outdents
    outdenting a case moves existing children with it
    outdenting picks up old siblings as new children
    outdenting when already at the left margin is ignored
    press and hold cursor down, starting with a focus'd row; focus should stay with selection
Case links
    URL hash part changes as case selection moved up and down
    URL with hash loads straight to the named case
    browser history does not accumulate each hash number, i.e. back still goes to previous page, not previous case
Import
    use menu option to open import dialog
    flat list of cases appended without structure
    newly appended cases are selected immediately after the import
    view jumps down to show new cases
    open import dialog again; should be empty
    add cases with a consistent indent pattern; import; new cases structure as per indents
    new import; add cases with inconsistent indent pattern; import; cases added with structure as per (normalised) indents
Export
    Export flat list of cases as text
    Export structured list of cases; text cases have indents accordingly
    Export text window can be selected, copied and pasted elsewhere
    Export structured list of cases, no results, as CSV; CSV opens in Excel with correct data
    Export cases with results as CSV; open in Excel; all data present
    Empty result columns export as CSV ok
    Sparse result columns export as CSV ok
    Issues and comments against results export as CSV ok
    Case notes and tags export as CSV ok
    Custom fields and their run values export ok

    shift up/down extends/contracts selection
    ctrl/cmd click selectively adds cases to the selection, non-coniguously
    shift-click after a ctrl-click extends from the last added case
    indent
        all rows of a multiple selection indented
        selection of parent and some children moves parent without changing children
        non-contiguous selection only applies indent to parents, all children move with parents
    outdent
        all rows outdented
        selection of parent and some children moves parent without changing children
        non-contiguous selection only applies outdent to parents, all children move with parents
    delete
        all selected rows deleted
        unselected children (with parent selected) survive
    move (ctrl-up/down)
        selected rows moved one row at a time as a block
        non-contiguous selections become contiguous and move to before or after the first/last row
        moving blocks up add them as siblings of the previous row
        moving blocks down add them as siblings if no children
        moving blocks down add them as first child if children already exist
        moved blocks stay in order
        moved blocks, where they start non-contiguous, remain in relative order

    dragging outside of the case table ignored
    insert positions restricted to as-sibling and as-child options only
