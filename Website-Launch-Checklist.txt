Security considerations
    // this section covers some of the basics
    // for much more detail, please see the info and cheat sheets at https://www.owasp.org/
    CSRF protection for all requests that effect server side changes
    User-generated content
        Prefer checking for valid input (whitelisting) rather than trying to refuse invalid (blacklisting)
        Use a trusted vs untrusted data policy in the application code
        Preferably use only parameterised database queries (prepared statements)
        Escape all user data
        Check escape syntax correct for use in
            html element content
            html attributes
            javascript 
            style elements
            url attributes
    Sites with user accounts / logins
        User cookies use the secure flag
        User cookies use the HttpOnly flag
        Session ID long enough not to prevent brute force attacks
        Session ID random enough not to be predictable
        Session ID must look random, i.e not leak information
        Renew session ID after privilege level changes
        Treat session IDs as untrusted data that requires validation before using in database queries
        Prefer as short a session expiration as makes sense for the application
        Consider automatic timeout of idle sessions
        Enforcement of password strength
        Consider bland authentication failure messages that don't say what failed
        Automatic account lockouts after repeated authentication failures
        Passwords only sent over HTTPS connections
        Authenticated pages all sent over HTTPS
        Sensitive data is transmitted between servers over secured connections (TLS)
        No sensitive data in URLs
        Pages with sensitive data are not cached
        Passwords (and other sensitive data) are stored encrypted in the database
        PCI compliance/certification if storing cardholder data
        Process for forgotten passwords reviewed
    HTTPS / TLS
        SSL certificates are for the live domain, not any staging domains
        No SSL errors or warnings in all main browsers
        SSL certificates have meta-data consistent with the brand and website
        All content loaded via HTTPS links, including off-site links, no mixed secure/insecure content
        Servers configured to only accept strong encryption
        Server only supports TLS version 1.0 or greater
        Private keys are strong, well stored and protected
        Preferably no redirect from HTTP to HTTPS (e.g. on / or /login)
Functional Testing
    // obviously need to also test all proprietary functionality of the site
    Check email delivery via third party service is working
    Check inbox placement success rate if DIY email delivery
    Site responds appropriately when javascript turned off
    Site responds appropriately when cookies turned off
    Search functionality works and produces relevant results
    Double click on buttons
    Forms reject invalid data
    Forms display friendly validation errors
    Unicode content (submits in forms and renders in content)
    Bot traps for publicly accessible forms
    Try markup and javascript in input fields
    Try sql injection style attacks in input fields
    Resize the browser through a range of sizes on all pages
    Visit beginning, middle and last pages of paginated lists
    Check forwards and backwards links work in paginated lists
    Embedded videos working, and load quickly and completely
    Browser Compatability
        Big screen browsers
            IE 9 & 10
            IE 8
            IE 7 and below
            ChromeFrame for IE

        Non-touch and smaller mobiles
            Opera Mini
            Provide meta tag to disable Google Wireless Transcoder if relevant
Performance testing
    Run YSlow on important pages
    Load testing - request volume
    Load testing - request size/impact
    Check page size and download times
Performance considerations
    Image sizes and optimisation
    Caching set correctly
    Content distribution network needed?
    Number of resources to download
    Compression of http content
    Minification/obfuscation of javascript and css
    Verbosity of CSS
    Database indexes
    Javascript declared/loaded after HTML content
Deployment process
    Rollback procedure ready
    Re-deployment on new servers tested for disaster recovery
    Deployment of servers, code and content is as automated as possible, preferably a single command/button
    Estimation of network and server loads after launch
    Capacity of service understood from load testing
    Responsibilities of team members understood for handling any problems post-launch
    Payment gateway switched to live mode (not left in test mode)
Updates requiring downtime
    Will downtime be required for an update?
    Staff and customers aware of any downtime
    Marketing campaigns (e.g adwords) paused
    Placeholder page ready during downtime
Post launch
    Suggest the site to the Open Directory Project (dmoz.org)
    Setup google alerts for key terms relating to the site
    Test the alerting and escalation process from time to time
    run A/B testing to experiment and improve conversion ratios
